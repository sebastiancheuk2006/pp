        <h3>Why I have chosen this project</h3> 
        <body>Hello, Iâ€™m Sebastian Cheuk and this is a website detailing the history of computers, from the first Turing machine in 1936, to the modern day computer revolution. This website includes an interactive timeline spanning the last century, a section on key figures that influenced the evolution of computers, and an overall summary of my findings. 

This website serves as a visual portfolio to present the findings of my personal research project:  The General History of Computers and Their Evolution Throughout Time.
The purpose of presenting my findings in the form of a website was for me to further understand  how websites are constructed, which is a vital part of the internet and something that most if not all navigate when using a computer. Therefore, as an additional part of my research project, I had to learn how to code using HTML and CSS, as well as how to host a website through Github pages.
